## üéØ Testing Guidelines

### For Cortex Search Service:
1. **Verify Semantic Understanding**: Questions should return relevant results even without exact keyword matches
2. **Check Context Extraction**: Responses should include surrounding context, not just matching sentences
3. **Test Boolean Logic**: Complex queries with AND/OR should filter appropriately
4. **Validate Page References**: Results should include accurate page numbers for source verification
5. **Assess Ranking Quality**: Most relevant results should appear first

### For Semantic Views:
1. **Natural Language Translation**: Questions should correctly translate to SQL with appropriate dimensions and metrics
2. **Aggregation Accuracy**: Verify SUM, AVG, COUNT calculations are correct
3. **Filter Application**: WHERE clauses should be properly generated from natural language
4. **Join Integrity**: Multi-table views should maintain proper relationships
5. **Performance**: Queries should return within reasonable time (<5 seconds)

### Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ All questions return meaningful, non-empty results
- ‚úÖ Numeric values match when verified against raw data
- ‚úÖ Natural language is correctly interpreted into SQL
- ‚úÖ Search results are relevant and properly ranked
- ‚úÖ Response time is acceptable for interactive use

### Common Issues to Watch For:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Empty results due to data type mismatches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Incorrect date filtering or formatting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing relationships between tables
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Case sensitivity in string comparisons
- ‚ö†Ô∏è NULL value handling in aggregations

## üìù Notes for Implementation

When integrating with Cortex Analyst, ensure:

1. **Semantic View Registration**: Both views are properly registered with Cortex Analyst
2. **Search Service Endpoint**: CARTA_DOCS_SEARCH_SERVICE is accessible to Analyst
3. **Proper Permissions**: Service account has SELECT access to all referenced tables
4. **Warehouse Sizing**: EQUITY_INTEL_WH is appropriately sized for concurrent queries
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Query performance and error rates are tracked

These questions provide comprehensive coverage of both structured data queries (semantic views) and unstructured document search (Cortex Search), validating the full intelligence platform capabilities.
