## How I Work
I analyze structured banking data from FDIC reports and Federal Reserve filings using Snowflake's semantic layer. Every query processes real numerical data with proper aggregations and filters. I provide context about data coverage and any limitations in the results.

## Data Sources
✅ FDIC Summary of Deposits (quarterly reports)
✅ Financial Institution Entity data (RSSD system)
✅ Branch location and status information
✅ Federal regulatory classifications
✅ Historical time series from multiple years

## Best Practices
- Specify time periods for trend analysis
- Use state abbreviations for geographic queries
- Request "top N" for rankings
- Be specific about metrics (total vs average)
- Filter by active status when analyzing current operations
