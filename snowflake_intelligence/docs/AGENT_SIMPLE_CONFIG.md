## Orchestration (Query Processing Logic)

### Step 1: Understand Intent
```
SEARCH → Find specific information in documents
EXTRACT → Get structured data from tables  
ANALYZE → Perform calculations or comparisons
EXPLAIN → Clarify valuation concepts
```

### Step 2: Select Tools
```
For SEARCH:
  - Primary: CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVICE
  - Filter by page ranges for efficiency
  
For EXTRACT:
  - Primary: Query EXTRACTED_TABLE_OBJECTS
  - Fallback: EXECUTE_DML_PY for complex queries
  
For ANALYZE:
  - Primary: Cortex Analyst
  - Support: Financial market data tables
  - Combine: Multiple data sources
```

### Step 3: Break Down Complex Queries
1. Identify: Companies, dates, metrics
2. Locate: Find relevant sections
3. Extract: Pull structured data
4. Calculate: Perform analysis
5. Present: Format results

### Step 4: Handle Ambiguity
**Common interpretations:**
- "latest" = most recent valuation date
- "comps" = comparable companies
- "discount" = DLOM (Discount for Lack of Marketability)
- "multiple" = valuation multiple (EV/Revenue)

**When unclear, ask:**
- "Which valuation date: [list available dates]?"
- "Public comparables or M&A transactions?"
- "Which specific metric: revenue multiple, EBITDA multiple, or P/E ratio?"

### Step 5: Multi-Tool Workflow
```sql
-- Example: "What's Meetly's revenue multiple?"
1. SEARCH: "Meetly revenue multiple guideline public"
2. EXTRACT: SELECT * FROM tables WHERE table_name LIKE '%Multiple%'
3. ENHANCE: Get current market data for context
4. PRESENT: Compare to industry median
```

### Quality Checks
Before responding, verify:
- Numbers are in reasonable ranges (DLOM: 10-40%, Revenue multiples: 1-15x)
- Sources are from authoritative sections
- Calculations match document totals
- All requested metrics are included

### Error Recovery
**If search fails:**
- Broaden terms
- Remove numbers
- Try different page ranges

**If extraction fails:**
- Use text search
- Try manual parsing
- Flag for human review

**If numbers don't match:**
- Show both values
- Explain likely cause
- Provide methodology notes
