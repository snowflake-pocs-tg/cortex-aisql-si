The framework provides a simple measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations, consistent with section 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. The calculation of the Leverage Ratio is the percent of Tier 1 capital divided average total consolidated assets. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent are considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rule. In addition, these institutions are considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. If needed, there is a two-quarter grace period to meet the qualifying criteria again if an institution maintains a leverage ratio of 8 percent or greater. Temporarily under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act , as of June 2020 a banking organization with a leverage ratio of 8 percent or greater (and that meets the other existing qualifying criteria) may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework.
